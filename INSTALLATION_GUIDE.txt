?? WINDOWS SMARTSCREEN WARNING - READ THIS FIRST!
------------------------------------------------

When you first run SyncOutlookToGoogle.exe, Windows may show:

    "Windows protected your PC"
    "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting"

? THIS IS NORMAL AND SAFE!

WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN?
- This is FREE, open-source software
- Code signing certificates cost $100-400 per year
- As a free app, we don't pay for signing
- Windows doesn't recognize apps it hasn't seen before

HOW TO RUN THE APP:
1. Click "More info" on the warning dialog
2. Click "Run anyway" button
3. The app will start normally

IS IT SAFE?
? YES! The source code is fully open and reviewable at:
   https://github.com/yourusername/SyncOutlookToGoogle

? The app only:
 - Reads your Excel file (local)
   - Syncs to Google Calendar (using OAuth)
   - Runs in your system tray

? No malware, no tracking, no data collection

STILL CONCERNED?
- Review the source code on GitHub
- Scan the .exe with your antivirus
- Check file properties (should show: Virtual Eyes Lab)
- Join our community discussions

================================================

QUICK START:
1. Ensure .NET Framework 4.7.2+ is installed
   Download: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472

2. Get Google OAuth credentials:
   - https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Create OAuth 2.0 Desktop App credentials
   - Download and rename to "client_secret.json"
   - **CRITICAL**: Place "client_secret.json" in the SAME FOLDER as SyncOutlookToGoogle.exe
   
   Example:
   ? C:\Program Files\PhilsSuperSyncer\SyncOutlookToGoogle.exe
   ? C:\Program Files\PhilsSuperSyncer\client_secret.json  ? Same folder!
   
   ? DO NOT place in a subfolder
   ? DO NOT place in the source code directory

3. Set up Power Automate with Sample Excel.xlsx

4. Run SyncOutlookToGoogle.exe
   - Select your Excel file
